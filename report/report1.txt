The aim of this project is to build a roulette casino game.

To achieve this an incremental approach will be taken.

The first task is to build a simple roulette wheel with a ball animation.
Initially I have used a jpg image as a background. However I decided to remove
this and create my own wheel oject out of arcs.

Ball is animated by RotateTransition() method, however as I set the setToAngle()
to a random number the ball can stop between the roulette pockets. To rectify this
I changed the random number generator's range to select a number between 0 and
36, then set the angle that corresponds to that numbers position on the wheel using
a really big and ugly switch statement e.g pocket 0 = 180deg. This will allow me to easily apply the
game logic to process a winning bit. Will look into possible ways to refactor this.

I decided to create an enum class for number that contains the number value,
angle value and colour. Thus the switch statement can be removed and replaced with
an iterator that loops through all the enum types and matches witht the random
selected number and returns the angle:
for (Number n : Number.values()) {
    if (n.getNumber() == number) {
        return n.getAngle();
    }
